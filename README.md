# Kirby Plainkit + Tailwind = ü§ç

This Repository extends the Kirby Plainkit by adding the following features:

- Define your CSS with [Utility-First](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Includes hot reloading using PostCSS and Gulp
- Kirby is added as a submodule for easy updates
- An opinionated selection of plugins and configurations that I use regularly

**Attention**: For advanced security, this project uses a [public folder setup](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/configuration#custom-folder-setup__public-folder-setup). This means that the root directory of the web server must point to the `./public` folder!

### Try Kirby for free  
You can try Kirby and the Plainkit on your local machine or on a test server as long as you need to make sure it is the right tool for your next project. ‚Ä¶ and when you‚Äôre convinced, [buy your license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

## HashandSalts SEO plugin

See: https://github.com/HashandSalt/kirby3-seo

After installing the plugin, setup controllers to bring in the shared SEO controller into each of your template
controllers.

The bare minimum controller looks like this:

```
<?php

return function ($page, $kirby, $site) {

  // SEO
  $seo = $kirby->controller('seo' , compact('page', 'site', 'kirby'));

  return $seo;

};
```

To override any of the values, you can do this inside your controller. For example, to change the format of the meta title, you could do this:

```
<?php

return function ($page, $kirby, $site) {

  // Meta
  $seo = $kirby->controller('seo' , compact('page', 'site', 'kirby'));

  // Override Meta Title
  $metatitle = $page->seotitle().' | '.$site->title();

  $data = compact('metatitle');

  return a::merge($seo, $data);

};

```
